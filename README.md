Developed a robust eCommerce platform showcasing my 
proficiency in full-stack web development. Leveraging the 
MERN stack—MongoDB for a dynamic database, Express.js for a 
scalable backend, React for a seamless and intuitive user 
interface—I crafted a feature-rich online shopping experience. 
The platform seamlessly integrates a secure shopping cart 
system, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user journey. 
Key highlights include the implementation of user and admin 
access controls, providing a secure and tailored experience for 
both customers and administrators. The MongoDB database 
ensures efficient data management, while API connections 
enhance the platform's functionality.
